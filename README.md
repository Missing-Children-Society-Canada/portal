## File Structure
We use the component approach in Sing App. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way 
to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained 
app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class.
 Here's how it looks:
```
sing/angular2/
 ├──config/                    * our configuration
 |   ├──helpers.js             * helper functions for our configuration files
 │   ├──webpack.dev.js         * our development webpack config
 │   ├──webpack.prod.js        * our production webpack config

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/`. We are currently using webpack.

# AoT  Don'ts
The following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use form.controls.controlName, use form.get(‘controlName’)
- Don’t use control.errors?.someError, use control.hasError(‘someError’)
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- Inputs, Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

# Types
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you can include external 
Type Definitions with @types

i.e, to have youtube api support, run this command in terminal: 
```shell
npm install @types/youtube @types/gapi @types/gapi.youtube
``` 
In some cases where your code editor doesn't support Typescript 2 yet or these types weren't listed in ```tsconfig.json```, 
add these to **"src/custom-typings.d.ts"** to make peace with the compile check: 
```es6
import '@types/gapi.youtube';
import '@types/gapi';
import '@types/youtube';
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with @types

```
npm install @types/node
npm install @types/lodash
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```

If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```
