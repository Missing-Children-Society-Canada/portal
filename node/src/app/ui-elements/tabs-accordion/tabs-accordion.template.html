        <p>You will never know exactly how something will go until you try it.</p>
        <p>You can think three hundred times and still have no precise result. If you see
          attractive girl all you need to do is to go and ask her to give you her phone. You don’t
          need to think about HOW it can turn out. All you have to do is to GO and DO IT. It
          should be super-fast and easy. No hesitation. You ask me: “What to do with these
          fearful thoughts preventing me from doing that?” The answer is to ignore them, because
          they can’t disappear immediately.</p>
        <p>The same thing is for startups and ideas. If you have an idea right away after it appears in your mind you should go and make a first step to implement it. </p>

          <p><span class="fw-semi-bold">Light Blue</span> - is a next generation admin template based on the latest Metro design. There are few reasons we want to tell you, why we have created it: We didn't like the darkness of most of admin templates, so we created this light one. We didn't like the high contrast of most of admin templates, so we created this unobtrusive one. We searched for a
            solution of how to make widgets look like real widgets, so we decided that deep background - is what makes widgets look real.

            <p>Why don't use Lore Ipsum? I think if some one says don't use lore ipsum it's very
              controversial point. I think the opposite actually. Everyone knows what is lore ipsum
              - it is easy to understand if text is lore ipsum. You'll automatically skip -
              because you know - it's just non-informative stub. But what if there some text like
              this one? You start to read it! But the goal of this text is different. The goal is
              the example. So a bit of Lore Ipsum is always very good practice. Keep it in mind!</p>
